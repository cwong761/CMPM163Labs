Answers:
24 a.) x = u * (width of texture)
   b.) y = (height of texture) - v * (height of texture)
   c.) x = 0.375 * 8 = 3
       y = 8 - (0.25 * 8) = 6
       (3, 6), which is a white grid.

1. I made the first cube by creating a cube and adding phong material (green) on it
2. It's similar to the first one, but instead of using phong material, I used lambert material (blue).
3. I first created a vertx shader and a fragment shader file for coloring. then, made variables and
   loader code. Lastly, created the function to build the cube and add animation.
4. The process is similar to (3), but the colors are changed.
